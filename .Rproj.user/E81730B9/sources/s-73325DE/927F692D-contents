# Lists

## What is a list

A [list](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#List-objects) can be thought of as zero or more (named) cells containing data of _any type_.

Elements may be named.

Elements are accessed through indexing operations.

## Creation

```{r}
study <- list(            # here = or <-
  name = "Bob",           # but here only =
  age = 44,               # never <-
  children = c( "Amy", "Dan", "Eve" )
)
study
```

The class of `study`:
```{r}
class( study )
```

Function `str` gives a compact display of an object structure/content:
```{r}
str( study )
```

## Length

Length of the list (number of elements):
```{r}
length( study )
```

## Getting names of the elements

```{r}
names( study )
```

## Getting a single element

Single elements can be accessed by their names in the list:
```{r}
study$age
study[[ "age" ]]
```
Note the double [[.

The type of the returned element depends on the element:
```{r}
class( study$age )
class( study$children )
```

Nonexisting elements will give `NULL` 

```{r}
study$parents
```

It is also possible to access elements by numerical index:
```{r}
study[[ 2 ]]
```

```{r results="asis", echo=FALSE, comment=""}
catLinkTaskSection( "createList", "04_lists.Rmd" );
```

## (*) Getting multiple elements as a list 

To get (possibly) multiple elements use single brackets notation:
```{r}
study[ c( "age", "children" ) ]
```

Note the difference:
```{r}
study[[ "age" ]]
study[ "age" ]
class( study[[ "age" ]] )
class( study[ "age" ] )
```

Accessing nonexisting elements with single brackets:
```{r}
study[ "parents" ]
class( study[ "parents" ] )
names( study[ "parents" ] )
is.null( study[ "parents" ] )
```

Numerical or logical indices may be also used:
```{r}
study[ c( 3, 1, 1 ) ]
study[ c( T, F, T ) ]
```

## (*) Removing an element 

A list element is removed by setting to NULL:
```{r}
str( study )
study[[ "children" ]] <- NULL;   # NULL means "nothing"
str( study )
```

## (*) Adding an element 

```{r}
str( study )
study$gender <- "male"
str( study )
```

```{r results="asis", echo=FALSE, comment=""}
catLinkTaskSection( "elementsList", "01_lists.Rmd" );
```
