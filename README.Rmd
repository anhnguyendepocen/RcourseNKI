# Using R for data analysis

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source, free environment for statistical computing and graphics. 
It provides a large repository of statistical analysis methods, both classic and new. 
However, R has a steep learning curve, due partly to its using a command-line type of user interface, rather than the usual pull-down menus. 
The course aims at helping researchers climb this curve, enabling them to perform basic data analysis and graphic displays at the end of the course, as well as giving a platform from which they can deepen their R knowledge later on if necessary.

## Teachers

- [Renee Menezes](http://www.bigstatistics.nl/renee), Biostatistics Unit, NKI (__coordinator__)
- Renaud Tissier, Biostatistics Unit, NKI
- Miriam Haaksma, PSOE, NKI

## Goals & Topics

After the course you will be able to:

- understand and write simple R scripts
- use R to perform simple statistical analyses of your own data
- use and adapt R scripts and functions 
- generate analysis reports from your own data in html format

We will cover the following topics:

- R expressions
- R data objects (vectors (arrays), data frames (tables), lists) creation and usage
- [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for building reproducible reports [[cheat sheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)]
- R functions for descriptive statistics and linear model fitting; R formula objects
- histograms, scatter plots, boxplots (in basic R) 

## Prerequisites

The course assumes no prior programming knowledge. Elementary statistics knowledge is necessary.

Participants must **bring own laptops** capable of running [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). 

Before the course **please prepare your laptop**:

1. install [R](https://www.r-project.org/), an open-source, free environment for statistical computing and graphics. You can find instructions for downloading and installing it from one of the CRAN mirrors, for example from the [Univ. of Gent](https://lib.ugent.be/CRAN/) or from the [Imperial College](https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/). A full list of mirrors can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).

2. install RStudio. Go to [the RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), select a version of RStudio appropriate for your laptop, download it and then install. Please check whether you can start RStudio. 

3. install [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/),  a very nice and easy tool to produce reports using RStudio. It is made available as an R package for Rstudio. One easy way to install it is as follows:

i) open RStudio

ii) click on the "File" menu on the top left, and choose "New file">"R Markdown". If RMarkdown is not yet installed on your machine, this will prompt you to install it and any packages required. Just follow the instructions that appear on the screen.


4. download the course materials [.zip file](`r params$RCourseURL`/R_course.zip) (see below) to your laptop. Unpack the zip file to a directory, and please check whether you can open `index.html` file from the directory.

## Materials

After the course material .zip file is downloaded, the course material can be assessed:

- as HTML pages by opening `index.html` in any browser
- by clicking on the `RcourseNKI.Rproj` file, which will open the entire course as an R project
- via [the course source git repository](`r params$RCourseGitURL`)

The materials contain a [`data` directory](`r params$RCourseURL`/tree/master/data) with the __data__ __files__ used in the presentations/tasks. The directory can be also accessed at `r params$RCourseURL`/tree/master/data

## Programme

### First NKI edition, June 15th, 16th, 18th 2020

This course will be given online via Zoom. All course days are in the period 9:00-16:00, with the last hour reserved for general Q&A.
