# First calculations {#firstCalculations}

- Calculate 25 plus the square of 12


- What is the square root of the number you have just calculated?


- (*) Check what `%%` and `%\%` do when applied to negative numbers. What is the logic here?



# First variables {#firstVariables}

- Make a variable that contains your height in m.


- Calculate your height in cm.


- Store the result of the previous calculation as a variable



# Making a vector {#exercisesBasics}

Four patients had dietary intakes of 2314, 2178, 1922, 2004 kcalories.

- Make a vector of these four values.

- Convert these values into in KJ using 1 kca = 4.184 kJ

- (*) Sort the resulting values using the function `sort`.



# Regular sequences

-	Make a vector of all numbers between 1 and 100. Hint: use `:`.


- Calculate 1+2+3+...+100. Hint: use `sum`.



# Vectorized calulation

- Degrees Celsius (Cel) can be calculated from degrees Fahrenheit (Fah) as Cel = 5/9 * (Fah - 32). How much is 60 degrees Fahrenheit in Celsius?


-	Calculate a vector that contains degrees Celsius for 0,1,...,100 degrees Fahrenheit.


- From your calculation in the previous exercise, select 10 Fahrenheit in Celcius.



# (*) Removing variables

- R knows the value of `pi`. Type `pi` to check


- Overwrite pi with a variable of your own 


- Remove and check that the old pi is available again 



# (*) Integer division and vectors

- Use `%/%` to make a vector of length 16 with values 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,...


- Use `%%` to make a vector of length 16 with values 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,...
