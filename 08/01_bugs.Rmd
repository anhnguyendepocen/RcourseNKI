## Bug reports

Sometimes you find a problem (error or strange result) in some package you have been using. This may be a bug. What to do?

1. (Re)read help files and documentation carefully
2. Search the web for similar reports
2. Check that you are using the latest version of the package
3. Restart R and reproduce the error/strange result
3. Make a bit of code that someone else can use to reproduce the error/strange result (use small anonymous data)
3. Write an email to R-help or to the package maintainer with your question (be polite). Always include sessionInfo().

Good bug reports are highly appreciated!
