# R Markdown : R code + Markdown text formating language

- RMarkdown ([cheat sheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)) is a simple language for creating professional reports
- It includes your R code output
- Use 
  - to share your data analysis with colleagues
  - to document your data analysis for future generations
- Capable of exporting various formats: `html`, `pdf` and  `word`


## Short session

  - Opening a new R markdown file
    - From RStudio  File -> New File -> R Markdown
    - Choose title and output format, choose `html` (default) here and press OK.
  - Knitting (compiling R Markdown) 
    - New R Markdown file contains example text and code generated for you.
    - To knit, press the `knit` button in Rstudio. It first asks you to save your file. Your file should have extension `.Rmd`
  - Quick exercises : Review the markdown with the html produced. What did R markdown do?

# Features of R Markdown

## Markdown examples

Use 

  - two spaces at the end of a line for new paragraph (newline)
  - hash (`#`) for section titles. 
  - dash (`-`) for bullet lists.
  - \*italic\*, \*\*bold\*\* and \~\~strike through\~\~ for  *italic*, **bold**, ~~strike through~~ respectively
  - \> to highlight 
  
> to highlight

## Including R code in markdown

R code is included in a `chunk`:

<pre><code>```{r}
x <- 5
x + 10
```</code></pre>

```{r}
x <- 5
x + 10
```

## Chunk options

There are many chunck options available, most common being `echo`, `eval`. For example the option results='hide' prevents the result of the `x + 10` being included in this page:  

<pre><code>```{r results='hide'}
x <- 5
x + 10
```</code></pre>

```{r results='hide'}
x <- 5
x + 10
```

And with plots

<pre><code>```{r results='hide'}
with(infert, hist(age))
```</code></pre>

```{r echo=FALSE}
with(infert, hist(age))
```

## R Studio and R Markdown

- R Markdown is well integrated with RStudio.
- By pressing `knit` a new R session is started and terminated after generating the report.
- This stand-alone nature helps to make sure that your analysis is ***reproducible***.
- The working directory of the markdown R session is the location of the markdown document.
- The knitting R session is independent from the R session in the RStudio console, this means that:
  - All data  needed for the generation of the report must be loaded/created by the scripts in the R Markdown document.
  - and conversely no data from R session in the R Studio console is accessible by the R session started for knitting. 
- It is possible to run a block of R code from R Markdown document inside the R Studio console.
- etc.

## Quick exercises

- Add an extra chunk to the default document that calculates the square root of 100.
- Give the new section a title and add a line of explanation in bold.

# Exercises

We'll make our first markdown.

## Revisiting Simple regression

- Go back to the exercise  1.1 Simple Regression part of  `Regression and formula objects` section. Format the questions and answers into a R markdown document.
- Knit the document to produce an Html
- `Optional` : Alternatively, produce a pdf. *Note, some platforms may need additional configuration steps to get PDF export working.*
